                                The color lavender has a rich history dating back to ancient times.
                                It was first used by the Egyptians in their art and in the process of
                                mummification. The ancient Greeks also valued the color and used it
                                to dye their clothing. In the 16th century, the color was used in
                                the royal courts of Europe as a symbol of power and wealth.
                            </p>

                                During the Victorian era, lavender became associated with refinement
                                and elegance, particularly in England. Women's clothing often
                                featured lavender-colored fabrics, and the color was also used for
                                interior design, particularly in wallpaper and drapery. The popularity
                                of lavender continued throughout the 20th century, particularly in the
                                1960s and 1970s, when it was associated with the hippie movement
                                and the counterculture.

                                Originally, the name lavender only applied to flowers. By 1930, the book
                                <i>A Dictionary of Color</i> identified three major shades of lavender; lavender,
                                lavender gray, and lavender blue, and in addition a fourth shade of lavender
                                called old lavender (a darker lavender gray).
                            </p>

                                By 1955, the publication of the ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names
                                (a color dictionary used by stamp collectors to identify the colors of stamps),
                                now on the Internet, listed dozens of different shades of lavender.
                                Today, although the color floral lavender (the color of the flower of
                                the lavender plant) remains the standard for lavender, just as there are
                                many shades of pink (light red, light rose, and light magenta colors),
                                there are many shades of lavender (some light magenta, some light purple,
                                light violet [as well as some grayish-violet], and some light indigo colors).
