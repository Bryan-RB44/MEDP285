        <h3>Mini-Biography</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Bryan Briones and I'm a senior majoring in
                Emerging Media after having done Computer Science a few semesters back. <br>
                I'm from Brooklyn and of Mexican descent, with my hobbies/favorite pastimes being cooking,
                making pixel art, some <br>coding especially on web and game development, and 
                (despite light pollution) both astronomy and astrophotography! <br>
                <i>I also own two cats named Luna and Sol, both unintentionally.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><strong>WARNING: Art seen below has been made in haste.</strong></i>
            </p>

        <h3>My Statement</h3>
            <p>
                To keep it short and simple, I like creating things and sharing with people the things I'm interested in.
                I prefer to create backgrounds in the pixel art style but am <br>very much open 
                to create objects, people, and so on, since I like to go outside my comfort zone especially when 
                I've been making art in this format for several years now.<br> Astrophotography is something I've 
                picked up recently a few years ago but it's still something I'm passionate about as I'm both very
                much into science <br>and sharing with people the things I get to see in spite of us living in
                such a bright city. Finally, game and web development is something I've had little <br>time
                in compared to everything else, but have done my best to gain more knowledge and skill in, as I feel 
                more in my element when creating something for people to <br>see in a way that impacts 
                them as well as simply liking coding (<i>despite the frustrations when your code doesn't
                work of course</i>).
            </p>

        <h3>My Goals for this Course</h3>
        <p>
            For this course, my goals would be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get the hang of using HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>Potentially get into using Javascript for web development.</li>
            <li>Become more efficient on using HTML/CSS.</li>
            <li>And finally, have a better understanding of web development as a whole.</li>
        </ul>
