                        Even though we live under starless skies, I still spite our light pollution
                        by looking at the night sky anyways. As most of our fellow New Yorkers
                        (or anyone living in cities for that matter) don't have the opportunity to see
                        what the sky holds after dark, I'll share whatever photos I have from my roughly
                        two years of experience with using telescopes to show what lies hidden every night.

                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy"  target="_blank">Whirlpool Galaxy</a> is one of the few things to be seen year-round here.
                        It's just barely bright enough to be seen visually but still a perfect target
                        for photography! It alongside its companion (as it's actually <strong>two</strong> galaxies) make
                        for a great target to start at when looking at objects outside our solar system!

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_21"  target="_blank">M21</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifid_Nebula"  target="_blank">Trifid Nebula</a> (top left and bottom right respectively) are
                        amazing sights to see during the Summer months. The former is a group of tightly
                        packed stars while the latter are star-forming parts of our galaxy. It's a great
                        sight to see both visually and with a camera with their brightness, with the benefit
                        of seeing more objects as you look deep and closeby our galaxy's core which isn't too
                        far away from this pair of objects.

                    <h2>NGC 3628, M66, and M65 - "Leo's Triplet"</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <img class="midish" src="images/NGC3628_M66_M65.jpg">
                    <p>
                        After seeing double twice, we now see a group of triplets! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Triplet"  target="_blank">Leo's Triplet</a>
                        is a close group of galaxies that are bright enough to be seen in the Spring skies
                        with ease. Without a doubt they're something to knock off any photographer's or
                        astronomer's bucket list, especially when there's even more galaxies nearby them
                        (which I haven't been able to capture in just one photo).
