                        Besides the large bodies out in deep space and in our own neighborhood, we
                        find other things we can see in our night sky. From the most well known to
                        the obscure, here's some other objects that I took a look at and captured
                        for people to see!

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"  target="_blank">Our Moon</a> is our planet's long time friend and everyone has seen it in their
                        lives at least a few times. Nothing beats watching it move in the sky, whether
                        day or night and with or without a telescope. Its changing shape yet simplicity
                        makes it ironically one of the few exciting constants in all our lives, making it something
                        we often take for granted when it's often seen as a dull rock in the sky.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12P/Pons%E2%80%93Brooks"  target="_blank">This comet</a> passed by us earlier this year and it didn't disappoint. Comets are
                        large chunks of dust and ice that come from the outer edges of our soler system. This
                        one in particular comes around every 71 years for that very reason, making it feel lucky to have the chance to
                        both see it and share photos of it to those who couldn't see it.

                    <h2>Dwarf Planets & Asteroids</h2>

                    <p>
                        Often the most underrated bodies in our own solar system, here are the dwarf planets
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" target="_blank">Ceres</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto" target="_blank">Pluto</a>, 
                        alongside the massive asteroids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta" target="_blank">Vesta</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Pallas" target="_blank">Pallas</a>. Yes, they're just dots
                        in these pictures as well as viewing for the fact that they are <em>tiny</em>, with all four
                        being the size of Australia or smaller. Regardless, they are still interesting parts to see, capture, and appreciate, at least for me. These are often the farthest and dimmest
                        objects you could see of our solar system from NYC, so it's best to appreciate them too if given the chance to view them.
