                        The planets of our neighborhood come in all shapes, sizes, and types, almost
                        all of which can be seen from our light polluted skies! Here are some of the
                        brightest ones that can be seen extremely easily on the months they're out for.

                    <p>
                        Named after the goddess of beauty, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus" target="_blank">Venus</a> is a hellish planet and is the 3rd brightest thing
                        in our sky (with only the Moon and the Sun beating it). Seething at temperatures
                        beyond our comprehension, we can safely see our closest neighbor from the comfort
                        of our own lawns/roofs and see its various phases. Never being too far from the Sun,
                        we can see it rise and dive in either the early mornings or late afternoon skies towards
                        the Eastern and Western horizons respectively (Western at the moment of this being typed).

                        This gaseous planet is incredibly far but still very much visible at being the 4th
                        brightest object in the sky, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" target="_blank">Jupiter</a> bearing 4 bright moons as well when seen with
                        even binoculars. Its iconic stripes make it great for seeing and imaging with proper gear!
                        (Unfortunately I had awful viewing conditions whenever I did try imaging this planet.)

                        While not as bright, the ringed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn" target="_blank">Saturn</a> is still easy to spot in our skies
                        and nobody can ever forget the first time ever witnessing the rings in person
                        through a telescope. It alongside its Earth-like moon Titan (seen in the brightened image)
                        are great sights for anyone with a telescope and I managed to get this solid picture with
                        great viewing conditions one lucky night.
