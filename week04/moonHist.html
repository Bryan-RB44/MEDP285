                                From the dawn of mankind to right before the advent of the telescope, mankind
                                has always looked up to the night sky at our planet's long time companion: our
                                Moon. We've depicted it in various forms of art throughout our history as it's
                                one of the largest and brightest objects in our skies only second to the Sun.
                                Its brightness and size makes it influential in both our culture and minds as
                                we continue to gaze and stare at it in awe and wonder.

                                Not long after the telescope was invented, people began using this new tool to
                                look up to the sky and see things no person has managed to see before. Galileo
                                Galilei alongside others looked up at the Moon to see its cratered surface, beating
                                the long standing myth that it was a perfect and smooth sphere but instead another
                                world just like ours. This led to mankind mapping out the Moon as much as we could
                                and only imagining what lies on that other world across the void, as it wouldn't
                                be until much later where we would have the chance to do so.

                                At long last, humanity has reached the Moon! Within the last 100 years we've managed
                                to not only send machines around the Moon but also land on it on several occasions,
                                some soley having machines involved and others having humans touch its surface at long
                                last. These missions helped shape our knowledge on both the Moon's past and what lies
                                in its future. With large plains of cooled magma, we now know our Moon used to be a
                                hot volcanic world born from the collision between Earth and another planet. With
                                collected samples and science from the Apollo missions, we know the Moon is still an
                                active world and how the Lunar environment impacts the human body. With further lander and
                                orbiter missions, we know that there's water on the Moon and caves, making the future
                                of mankind's space exploration a big possibility that all relies on our celestial friend.
