                    As you've now read, we are now going out of business due to investigations from
                    law enforcement for running an illegitimate business and from several universities for using school resources without any proceeds going towards them. The good news for our valued costumers is that any sales made before the last 24 hours are valid and final; buyers keep their courses and sellers make their final sales. The bad news however, is that all currently processing transactions are now forfeit to the owners of the marketplace.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p class="textFont">
                    If you've made a purchase within the last 24 hours and the payment is still processing, that money is now forfeit to the owners of this site and your purchase has been cancelled. As for sellers, all listings are now pulled while purchases in-progress are now cancelled with proceeds going to the site's owners.
                </p>
                <h1 class="headGlow">Thank you once again for your continued support up until the very end</h1>
