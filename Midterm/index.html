                    automatically filled up as soon as your enrollment date
                    comes? Are you also sick of having to bear with courses you'd
                    never otherwise take? Have you also needed to change a class after that
                    "Staff" turns into an infamous professor's name in the
                    course description?

                    Satire-aside, this website serves as commentary to the struggle that
                    students at Hunter College face when it comes to obtaining classes
                    that they need in their academic careers.

                    in the semester, this site is meant to represent that sense
                    of frustration and desperation in students. While it's intentionally
                    written less formally, it is meant to show that it's still very well likely
                    that some might turn to
